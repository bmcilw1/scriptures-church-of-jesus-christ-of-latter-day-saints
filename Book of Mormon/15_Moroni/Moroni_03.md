##### 1

The manner which the disciples, who were called the elders of the church, ordained priests and teachers--

##### 2

After they had prayed unto the Father in the name of Christ, they laid their hands upon them, and said:

##### 3

In the name of Jesus Christ I ordain you to be a priest, (or, if he be a teacher) I ordain you to be a teacher, to preach repentance and remission of sins through Jesus Christ, by the endurance of faith on his name to the end. Amen.

##### 4

And after this manner did they ordain priests and teachers, according to the gifts and callings of God unto men; and they ordained them by the power of the Holy Ghost, which was in them.
