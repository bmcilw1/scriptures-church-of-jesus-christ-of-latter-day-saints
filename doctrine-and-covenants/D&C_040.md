# D&C 040

##### 1

BEHOLD, verily I say unto you, that the heart of my servant James Covill was right before me, for he covenanted with me that he would obey my word.

##### 2

And he received the word with gladness, but straightway Satan tempted him; and the fear of persecution and the cares of the world caused him to reject the word.

##### 3

Wherefore he broke my covenant, and it remaineth with me to do with him as seemeth me good. Amen.
