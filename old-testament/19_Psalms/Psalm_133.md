# Psalm 133

##### 1

BEHOLD, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!

##### 2

It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;

##### 3

As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.
