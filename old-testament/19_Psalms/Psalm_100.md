# Psalm 100

##### 1

MAKE a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.

##### 2

Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.

##### 3

Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.

##### 4

Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.

##### 5

For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.
